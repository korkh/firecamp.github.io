        What is the significance of the forest?
      </h2>
    </div>
      <div class="title border"><p>
        Forest is the creator of a comfortable climate for humans. The forest influences the uniform filling of rivers and lakes with water.
        The forest weakens the erosion of soil by precipitation, reduces the force of the wind, enriches the air with water vapor,
        and weakens the fluctuation in air temperature.
        The forest gives us food.
        The forest is a home for animals. Their variety is so huge that every dry stump, every blade of grass serves as their home.
        Wood is used in various industries: cellulose, feed sugar, glucose, paper, nitrocellulose, and cellulose acetate are obtained from it.
        The forest is a source of chemicals obtained during the processing of wood, bark, pine needles. The furniture in our houses is also made of wood.
        The forest is a resting place.
        The role of the forest is great, which means that a person should also feel responsible for his actions in the forest.

        Why is there less forest?
      </h2></div>
      <div class="title border"><ol>
        <li>
          <span>First</span>, the demand for wood is growing.
          Forests are being destroyed so quickly that the area of cuttings exceeds the area planted.
          In connection with deforestation, the water resistance of rivers decreases,
          lakes become shallow and dry.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <span>Secondly</span>, forests suffer severely from fires.
          Forest fires in most cases occur through human fault, sometimes,
          of course, as a result of natural phenomena.
          The blaze of forest fires destroys everything in its path: both flora and fauna.
        </li><br>
        <li>
          <span>Third</span>, forests suffer from diseases and pests.
          Fighting fires is essential. A fire is easier to prevent than to extinguish.
          A person should behave correctly in the forest: do not light fires,
          do not throw cigarette butts, glass bottles, do not set fire to old grass.
          A different type of vegetation develops on forest burned-out areas, and the animal population changes completely.
