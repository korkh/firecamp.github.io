        <h1>Let's start cherishing the forest right now! Use the <span>Fire Camp app!</span></h1>
        <p>
            This app developed to <strong>ANONYMOUSLY</strong> (can be done on the place by GPS or even after recreation time just
            manually choose location) <strong>register campfires or barbecues</strong> to identify the places most frequently visited
            by people for outdoor recreation. <strong>Application</strong> is used to create a map of a person's favorite recreation areas,
            especially with the use of open fire: whether it be a barbecue or just to warm up on a cool evening.
            In addition to the fact that everyone will be able to find a new resting place in which they have never been,
            this application will primarily become a signal for the local fire station, emergency medical rescue station,
            as well as the local administration. If the resting place becomes visited by a human being,
            it must at least be equipped with an appropriate place for the safe lighting of a fire, as well as waste bins.
            This program will primarily help emergency services identify areas with the most likely fires.
            They will be able to prepare a tactical fire-fighting plan, considering the designated terrain.
            This will increase the efficiency of fire-fighting and therefore with the ability to minimize the loss of forest
            and local fauna in a given area.

        <h2>
            <span>WHY</span> SHOULD I DO THIS?
        </h2>
        <p>
            If the awareness that you are helping not only nature but also all of humanity is not enough for using the application
            we need motivate people to register their holiday destination using open fire, it requires to encourage them in some way,
            such as issuing a coupon discount on some goods or products or etc.
            In a year's time, the registrations will be a map of such places.
            Even if it was prohibited to use open fire there, but the place is used repeatedly, for example because of the beauty of the landscape,
            <strong>it is necessary to equip it with the appropriate anti-fire places</strong>it is necessary to equip it with the appropriate anti-fire places and install containers for garbage collection. The app must transmit
            information about the registration of such places to the information collection center (or to web page) to track the occurrence of fires.
